This code is related to the birthday paradox problem to evaluate:
1. average number of people to observe a conflict and compare with the theoretical result
2. probability of birthday conflict in function of m and compare with the theoretical result

Scripts:
1. Birthday_Paradox: main code to be executed
2. Real_Bth_Distribution: function to produce the real distribution of birthdays
3. US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS: .txt file inccluding the data for real distribution of birthdays

Run: Birthday_Paradox.py must be run to see all the results and plots
