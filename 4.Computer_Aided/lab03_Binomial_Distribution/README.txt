this code is about generating binomial and normal random variables. 
for the fisrt one, there three scripts including the functions for convolution, inverse_transform and geometric methods.
for the second one, the whole process is performed in the main scripts including the graghs.

to run the code, it is needed to run Main_Binomial_Normal_Distribution.py through the command %run file.py.
then all results would be shown in the main file.
